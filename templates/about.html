    I am a final year PhD candidate at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">Mila</a> and the University of Montreal, supervised by <a href="http://sarathchandar.in/">Sarath Chandar</a>. My research focuses on studying the fundamental principles of human intelligence by creating agents that can adapt to new situations and work with different partners, with the ultimate goal of developing cooperative intelligence.
